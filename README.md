👨‍💻 Project Steps (in human-friendly terms)
1️⃣ I started by designing the Account class in Java to handle:

Creating an account with name, number, email, type, and balance

Deposit and withdraw logic with checks

Displaying account info cleanly

2️⃣ I built a Main class with a menu so anyone can use the app from the terminal.

3️⃣ Then I designed the frontend pages (HTML/CSS/JS) with an orange theme that looks like a modern banking app.

4️⃣ All code is kept simple so it can be compiled easily and understood by beginners.

📌 Future Improvements
✨ Add password authentication
✨ Connect to a database (e.g., MySQL)
✨ Build REST API endpoints
✨ Add a working frontend-backend connection
